# Face_Generation_WGAN
Developed an advanced machine learning model utilizing a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to generate realistic human faces.
Leveraged the comprehensive CelebA dataset, consisting of over 200,000 celebrity images, for training the model to ensure high-quality and diverse facial feature synthesis.
Fine-tuned the WGAN architecture to optimize the balance between generator and discriminator, resulting in enhanced image quality and stability during training.
Implemented data preprocessing  to improve model robustness and to handle a wide range of facial attributes and variations.
Utilized Python and Pytorch for model development, and employed rigorous testing methods to ensure the model's reliability and efficiency.
